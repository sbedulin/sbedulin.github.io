The more you know JavaScript the less you know JavaScript. That's `!!"true"`.

I came across [Kyle's YDKJS book series][github] a couple of times but 
it's not until I watched [his Pluralsight course on Advanced Javascript][ps-advanced] 
I actually wanted to dive deeper (there is also a [basics course][ps-basic] if you are interested).

- books are free and available on [GitHub][github]
- good examples and overall great quality of material. 
Some metaphors are so cool that give a sense of "Eureka!" and "How didn't I think about this before?"
- debatable topics are addressed by author in [Issues section][github-issues]
- highly recommended! 
Beginners, intermediate, advanced levels will find a lot of useful and practical information 

Thank you Kyle!
